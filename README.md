# Changing UNET attribute permissions

Before a change to `System: Read UNET ID` can take effect, you need to
remove the existing permission from LDAP (just running `install.sh` won't
overwrite the existing perms):
```
ldapmodify -h localhost -p 389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w $PASSWORD < delete_unet_permission.ldif
```
